    % The spectrometer consists of two razor blades with only a very tiny slit inbetween to let the light
    % into the device. Next is a cd that acts as a grating. This grating pattern will deflect the light to create
    % a diffraction pattern. Lastly, a camera is placed behind the cd, to take pictures of said phenomenon.
    

\begin{abstract}
    This paper covers our attempt at building a spectrometer from just household materials. 
    Light enters the apparatus through a tiny slit between two razor blades and travels through 
    a CD acting as a grating and forming a diffraction pattern which is then caught by a camera.
    It was now necessary to calibrate our device, in order to take accurate measurements. As we did not have a 
    monochromatic light source at hand, we took some of the calibration constants from literature.
    We were able to successfully build and calibrate the spectrometer. With our finished device we then analyzed
    different types of light sources. In our case, the spectrometer is useful for basic analysis of light,
    but cannot display minor details as the Fraunhofer lines for example.
