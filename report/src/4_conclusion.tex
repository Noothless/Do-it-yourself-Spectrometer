\section{Conclusion}
    In this experiment we successfully built our own spectrometer using the grating feature of a cd.
    As a first step we were required to calibrate the spectrometer.
    As we did not have a monochromatic light source at hand, we used a literature value for the grating
    constant $g$. Next we had to determine the distance $d$ of the camera sensor and the grating.
    We concluded that $\bf d = (1.71 \pm 0.12) ~\si{\bf\milli\meter}$.
    Finally, we were able to analyze some different light sources, to determine their respective wave spectrums.
    We found that some indoor ceiling lights emit only certain wavelengths, while others emit almost the entire
    visible spectrum.
    We are very happy with how our spectrometer turned out. We are able to calculate the wavelength of any color
    in the detected spectrum, with a satisfactory error margin.
